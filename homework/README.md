# Homework

This folder contains data engineering assignments and exercises. Each assignment should be in its own subfolder with a `README.md` describing the task, required files, and how to run or test it.

Example structure:

```
homework/
├── assignment-1/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── data/
└── assignment-2/
    └── README.md
```
